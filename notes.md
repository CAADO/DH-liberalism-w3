After starting, it took about 5 mins to figure out internet is not going to function. 

REGEX section went well, I'm familiar in the general sense with search functions like this. Only errors were PEBCAC that I will decline to list

When opening the OR document, the instructions seemed to expect the headers to be split, but mine were all in one. I split them manually.

Instruction 11 refers to instruction 12, which does not exsist, but it's understood just fine. 

Open Refine section went well, feels a lot like excel. No errors.

It's almost traumatic how much work knowing about these visualisation sites would have saved me over the past year...

for networks, I'm using palladio. It worked, no errors. 

I had to rename the line titles source and target in excel after a failure on gephi. 

I was confused for a moment, but my question had already been asked and answered in the discord. 

I had to play with the sizing to make the network functional, but it worked fine. 

I'm left with a functional final product.

I'm not doing the bonus right now becuase I really don't feel like getting on the struggle bus to download more packages. Once the 30th is past, I might come back to it.
